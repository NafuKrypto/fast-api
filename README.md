## Automatic Docs
Best thing for the fast API

**1. Swagger UI**
  - genrally we use the postman but thats not a good thing.
  - So by default, fast api provide you the swagger ui where we can simply check what are the routes we have created or api endpoints we have       created. 
  - We can also try them out check what is we are creating , how it is going to respond
  
**2. ReDoc** 
- having a very nice and minimal design for the documentation

## Just Modern Python
1. Python 3.6 with type using Pydantic library
- No new syntax to learn. Just standard modern Python.

## Based on Open Standards
1. JSON schema
- by default returns json which every modern api need to communicate with other things
2. Open API
- is a linux foundation under linux foundation and it defined how we create our api
